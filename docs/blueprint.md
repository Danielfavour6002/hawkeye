# **App Name**: HawkEye

## Core Features:

- Anomaly AI: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (trained on the NSL-KDD dataset) as a tool to identify unusual network traffic patterns indicative of potential intrusions targeting the Rivers State University portal.
- Traffic Watch: Continuously monitors network traffic to the Rivers State University portal, capturing relevant data for analysis.
- Intrusion Alert: Flags suspicious activities detected by either the anomaly-based or signature-based detection components, providing real-time alerts to administrators.
- Traffic Classify: Classifies network traffic as either normal or intrusive based on the analysis from both detection methods.
- Traffic Log: Maintains a detailed log of all network traffic, detected anomalies, identified signatures, and classifications for auditing and incident analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey security and trust.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during long monitoring sessions.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight critical alerts and important data points.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear readability and a modern interface.
- Use clear, outlined icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different types of network events and security statuses.
- Dashboard should feature a clean, modular layout with clear sections for real-time traffic, anomaly alerts, signature matches, and logs.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., fading, sliding) to draw attention to newly detected threats or updated data without being disruptive.
